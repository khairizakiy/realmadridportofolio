                <p><strong>Real Madrid</strong> host Celta this evening at the <strong>Santiago Bernabéu</strong> for a
                    single-game knockout tie in the
                    <strong>Copa del Rey</strong> Round of 16. This will be the first time the
                    <strong>madridistas</strong> play on home turf this year,
                    having been on the road for their opening four fixtures (9:30pm CET). <strong>Ancelotti's</strong>
                    charges will be
                    fully focused on securing their place in Monday's quarter-final draw.
                    <br> <br>
                    Our boys haven't played in front of the home fans since 22 December, when they beat Sevilla 4-2 to
                    close out 2024 on a high. With the fixtures still coming thick and fast this year, <strong>Real
                        Madrid</strong> now
                    face three successive games at the <strong>Bernabéu</strong>. After tonight's Copa clash, they'll
                    welcome Las Palmas
                    in <strong>LaLiga</strong> this weekend, and then Salzburg in the Champions League.
                    <br> <br>
                    <i>“This game will do us good, we want to see a reaction,"</i> underlined <strong>Ancelotti</strong>
                    in the pre-match press
                    conference. The Italian confirmed Lunin is set to start in the sticks against Celta, and has already
                    named his squad as he looks to book a quarter-final spot. <b>Mbappé</b> and <b>Vini Jr.</b>, the
                    team's top
                    scorers so far this season, are both on the list.
                    <br> <br>
                    Celta
                    This evening sees the Galician side face their fourth away trip in this edition of the Copa del Rey.
                    They come into the Round of 16 following impressive wins over Racing Santander (2-3), Salamanca UDS
                    (0-7) and San Pedro (1-5).

                <p>
                    Defeat in the final of the <b>Spanish Super Cup</b> against Barcelona at the King Abdullah Sports City
                    stadium in Jeddah (Saudi Arabia). The match started at a frenetic pace with chances galore. The
                    first two were for Barcelona with a shot by <b>Lamine Yamal</b> and a header by <b>Raphinha</b> that forced
                    <b>Courtois</b> into two good stops. Our team's response was as immediate as it was forceful. <b>Mbappé</b>
                    received the ball with plenty of space in front of him and drove into the box, where he danced past
                    Balde with a fine dribble and slotted past Szczesny.
                    <br> <br>
                    Only five minutes were on the clock and <b>Real Madrid</b> had already taken the lead, but <b>Lamine Yamal</b>
                    equalised midway through the first half after a solo run. <b>Ancelotti‘s</b> side came close to taking the
                    lead again in the 24th minute. <b></b> swung in the corner and <b>Tchouameni's</b> header forced <b>Szczesny</b>
                    into a fine save. The game was a constant back and forth and on 35 minutes referee <b>Gil Manzano</b> blew
                    for a penalty against <b>Camavinga</b> for a foul on Gavi at the behest of the VAR. <b>Lewandowski</b> converted.
                    <br> <br>
                    It was further complicated by <b>Raphinha</b> converting with a deader from <b>Koundé-s</b> long pass to make it
                    1-3. And before half-time, <b>Balde</b> made it 1-4 with a counter-attack. <b>Madrid</b> could have made it 2-4
                    after the break when <b>Rodrygo's</b> volley hit the crossbar, but <b>Raphinha</b> made it 1-5. In the 56th
                    minute, <b>Szczesny</b> was sent off following a VAR review for bringing down <b>Mbappé</b> on the edge of the box
                    when he had already gone past him. <b>Rodrygo</b> took the free-kick and beat <b>Iñaki Peña</b> to make it 2-5
                    which was how the game ended.
